# ChromeOS Firmware Updater

This repository contains the firmware updater (`chromeos-firmwareupdate`) that
will update firmware images related to verified boot, usually AP (also known as
BIOS or MAIN) and EC.

[TOC]

## Introduction
Auto update is one of the most important feature in Chrome OS. Updating
firmware is one of the most complicated process, since all Chromebooks come
with firmware that implemented [verified
boot](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/verified-boot)
and must be able to update in background silently.

## Using Firmware Updater

The firmware updater was made as a "shellball", a self-executable file
containing updater logic (shell scripts), utility programs, and firmware images.

### Update manually

Usually you can find the updater in `/usr/sbin/chromeos-firmwareupdate`
on a ChromeOS device (or the rootfs partition of a disk image).

To look at its contents (firmware images and versions):

    chromeos-firmwareupdate -V

Usually for people who wants to "update all my firmware to right states", do:

    chromeos-firmwareupdate --mode=recovery

> The `recovery` mode will try to update RO+RW if your write protection
> is not enabled, otherwise on RW.

If your are not sure about write protection status but you only want RW to be
updated, run:

    chromeos-firmwareupdate --mode=recovery --wp=1

> The `--wp` argument will override you real write protection status.

### Simulating ChromeOS Auto Update

The ChromeOS Auto Update (`update_engine`) runs updater in a different way - a
[two-step trial process](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/firmware-boot-and-recovery).

If you want to simulate and test that, do:

    chromeos-firmwareupdate --mode=autoupdate

> `autoupdate` may automatically switch to `recovery` mode under certain
> conditions, especially if your write protection is not enabled. To really
> simuate the 2-step update process, add `--wp=1 --nocheck_rw_compatible`.

## Building Firmware Updater

The updater is provided by the
[`virtual/chromeos-firmware`](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/master/virtual/chromeos-firmware)
package in Chromium OS source tree, which will be replaced and includes the
`chromeos-base/chromeos-firmware-${BOARD}` package in private board overlays.

To build an updater locally, in chroot run:

    emerge-${BOARD} chromeos-firmware-${BOARD}

If your board overlay has defined USE flags `bootimage` or `cros_ec`,
`chromeos-firwmare-${BOARD}` package will add dependency to firmware and EC
source packages (`chromeos-bootimage` and `chromeos-ec`), and have the firmware
images in `/build/${BOARD}/firmware/{image,ec}.bin`. A "local" updater will be
also generated in `/build/${BOARD}/firmware/updater.sh` so you can run it to
test the locally built firmware images.

> In other words, you can remove `bootimage` and `cros_ec` in branches that you
> don't need firmware from source, for example the factory branches or ToT,
> especially if there are external partners who only has access to particular
> board private overlays.

## Manipulating Firmware Updater Packages

The firmware updater packages lives in private board overlays:
`src/private-overlays/overlay-${BOARD}-private/chromeos-base/chromeos-firmware-${BOARD}/chromeos-firmware-${BOARD}-9999.ebuild`.

Usually there are few fields you have to fill:

### CROS_FIRMWARE_MAIN_IMAGE
A reference to the Main (AP) firmware image, which usually comes from
`emerge-${BOARD} chromeos-booimage` then `/build/${BOARD}/firmware/image.bin`.

Usually this implies both RO and RW. See `CROS_FIRMWARE_MAIN_RW_IMAGE` below for
more information.

> You have to run `ebuild-${BOARD} chromeos-firmware-${BOARD}.ebuild manifest`
> whenever you've changed the image files (`CROS_FIRMWARE_*_IMAGE`).

### CROS_FIRMWARE_MAIN_RW_IMAGE
A reference to the Main (AP) firmware image and only used for RW sections.

If this value is set, `CROS_FIRMWARE_MAIN_IMAGE` will be used for RO and this
will be used for RW.

### CROS_FIRMWARE_EC_IMAGE
A reference to the Embedded Controller (EC) firmware image, which usually comes
from `emerge-${BOARD} chromeos-ec` then `/build/${BOARD}/firmware/ec.bin`.

### CROS_FIRMWARE_EC_RW_IMAGE
Similar to `CROS_FIRMWARE_MAIN_RW_IMAGE` - just for EC.

### CROS_FIRMWARE_STABLE_MAIN_VERSION
A version number to indicate "the expected stable (RO) main firmware version".
Devices with firmware version smaller than stable (or if the stable was set to
empty) will get RO+RW update if write protection is not enabled; otherwise only
RW update.

This can be considered as a setting for "which RO version I want to keep for
dogfood devices when they receive AU".

> Devices without write protection will always get RO+RW updated by recovery,
> that's why this option is not called `RO_VERSION`. It's named "stable" to
> indicate that the version here is simply a suggestion for updating or not.

Ideally, this should be used as:
 - Empty when the updater package was created.
 - Keep empty until you've got first FSI firmware candidate.
 - Set the STABLE to FSI firmware version and never change.

In other words, STABLE should be the "first shipped RO".

However, we do see the need of "pushing AU to dogfooders to test new RW or new
RO". STABLE can be used to control this:
 - Keep STABLE unchanged if you want to push a RW-only update.
 - Change STABLE to larger number if you want to enforce a RO update.

> When STABLE is not empty, implicit key changing is not allowed in AU mode, so
> you if you want to push key changes, for example PreMP to MP, you have to
> uprev `CROS_FIRMWARE_MAIN_IMAGE` as well, or temporarily set STABLE to empty.

### CROS_FIRMWARE_STABLE_EC_VERSION
Same as CROS_FIRMWARE_MAIN_IMAGE, except that this is for EC.

## Technical Details
The firmware updater is built by running `pack_firmware.sh`, which collects
firmware image and extra files, all files under `pack_dist` folder, archived by
running [`shar`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sharutils/), with a special
bootstrap stub `pack_stub`.

Since the verified boot has been evolved with so much differences, we put the
updating logic in different files according to the generation of firmware:
`pack_dist/updater*.sh`. Most Chromebooks today should use `updater4.sh`.

Usually we will increase a "logic version" when the verified boot has been
changed so much that the updater code for previous versions would almost won't
work. Currently we have defined these versions
(Use [Developer Info](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices)
 page to find the mapping from board names to product names):

 - Version 1: mario (CR48), useing H2C BIOS.
 - Version 2: alex and zgb.
 - Version 3: lumpy, stumpy, butterfly, stout, parrot.
 - Version 4: Everything after version 3 until now.
 - Version 5: Was created for vboot2, but now it's merged back to Version 4.

This will be mapped to what you should set in the `CROS_FIRMWARE_SCRIPT` value
in ebuild files.
