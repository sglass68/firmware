This folder contains additional firmware update helper scripts.

Files must be named as ${FILE} or ${FILE}.${version}, and then installed to
/usr/sbin/${FILE} by cros-firmware.eclass.

If ${version} is specified, then it will be installed only if the ${version}
matches the version code in CROS_FIRMWARE_SCRIPT variable.
